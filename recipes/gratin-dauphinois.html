            <li>Spread the potatoes in the baking dish, taking care to salt the potatoes in each layer (not too much: the milk-cream mixture is already salty).</li>

            <li>Let cook for 35 to 45 minutes, cooking time varies depending on the variety of potatoes used.</li>
            <li>Remove your gratin from the oven and let it rest for about ten minutes before serving.</li>
